### My very messy notes - to be cleaned
everyone is a place maker

there is an endless capacity to transform the mundane we experience every day

would people talk to each other?
would children be safe?


maybe it’s time for a little bit of whimsy

makes a community so much stronger
have never seen anything build community quite like this
if people unleash their creativity in the space between their homes, maybe they’ll be changed

ownership of place
intergenerational

creative misbehaviour

the village square is the catalyst

community of adults who are receptive

edible landscapes

retrofit greenhouses

change the diagram of power

reclamation of place by everyone

projects to expand resilient neighbourhood



Nodes and organs of the place
How do people know they’re entering this place

colonial grid

think about ways to, given that can’t change of grid now, but how we can alter to achieve revillaging

Solano’s resilience hub

movement called new urbanism
* walkable community
* raise a similar comparison
    * need to understand that patterns installed by for-profit orgs, but our lives do depend on ei
    * to him the grid is a form of violence
* architectural classicism - racist
    * neither created by community themselves
* geomorphic settlements - ecological responses adapted to their environment
    * e.g. opens to south to capture sun, shade, etc
    * response to climate and addresses their culture


Medieval places
* we’re seeing a crystallized landscape of inequity
* manifest at time before women had equal opportunity
* exciting to him in Vallejo - what does it look like to embrace equity on broad and deep scale
    * what would public spaces looks like that express what we’ve become
    * capitalism - we’ve become less convivial - fewer spaces to sit in space
        * what would it look like if we fear didn’t drive us
        * what would it look like if we saw humans as people
